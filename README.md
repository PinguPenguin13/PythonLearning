About Me:
I am a Physics student at Ca√±ada College transfering out for the 2024-26 school year hoping to get my undergraduate at a four year university.
I enjoy hiking and collect hot wheels.

Goals for CIS117:
I would like to get a base understanding of Python and how to use it to benefit me in general life. I have already learned some cpp, but find it a bit more finicky and too difficult to get things that I could use in my day to day life working.

My first Python Program:
```
print("Hello World")
```
